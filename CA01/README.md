**Computer Assignment #1: Exploratory Data Analysis - House Price Analysis**
----

Exploratory Data Analysis is an approach analyzing data sets to summarize their main characteristics such as mean, standard deviation, and count, so on, often with visual methods. It’s where the researcher takes a bird’s eye view of the data and tries to make some sense of it.

**What is it about?**
---
This data provides values of various features that “might” be predictive of house prices. In other words, if a ML model is developed using this dataset, potentially such a model can be used to determine the “listing price” of a property that the owners are planning to sell.

**What information does it have?**
---
The dataset comes with the following files. You can view them at: [github.com/ArinB/MSBA-CA-Data/CA01](http://github.com/ArinB/MSBA-CA-Data/CA01)

- Data Description text file
- house-price-train.csv
- house-price-test.csv

**3 Parts to the Code**
---
Part 1: Data Understanding – We explored various visualization of the variable analysis and finally the Data Quality Report that identifies the data problems that exist in this dataset.

Part 2: In this part we fixed the data problems identified in the Data Quality Report.

Part 3: For this part, we explored the “collinearity” visualization and identification of the features that need to be dropped (feature selection), if any.
