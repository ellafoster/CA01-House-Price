**CA01- Exploratory Data Analysis - House Price Analysis**
The dataset is from github.com/ArinB/MSBA-CA-Data/CA01

**What is it about?**
This data provides values of various features that “might” be predictive of house prices. In other words, if a ML model is developed using this dataset, potentially such a model can be used to determine the “listing price” of a property that the owners are planning to sell.

**What information does it have?**
The dataset comes with the following files. You can view them at: github.com/ArinB/MSBA-CA-Data/CA01
- Data Description text file
- house-price-train.csv
- house-price-test.csv

**There are 3 parts to this code**

Part 1: Data Understanding – We explored various visualization of the variable analysis and finally the Data Quality Report that identifies the data problems that exist in this dataset.

Part 2: In this part we fixed the data problems identified in the Data Quality Report.

Part 3: For this part, we explored the “collinearity” visualization and identification of the features that need to be dropped (feature selection), if any.
