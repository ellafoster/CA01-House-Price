**MSBA- Introduction to Machine Learning Course**
----

Goals for this course:
-------------------------
• Collect data from primary and secondary sources

• Consolidate and cleanse data coming from multiple sources in multiple formats

• Design and implement various data architectures for effective storage, management and analysis of data

• Use programming languages and software packages to perform statistical analysis on a given data set

• Apply data-mining techniques to support decision-making for business problems

Background:
-------
This course will provide a hands-on application-oriented exposure to machine learning (ML), while taking a deep dive into the fundamentals of supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms, model selection, feature engineering, data fitting, model evaluation and optimization. Learn how to instantiate, test, and deploy ML models using Python
libraries and platforms such as Azure ML, using real life data sets. Finally, students will develop the skills to interpret ML based predictive models to support business decision making.
